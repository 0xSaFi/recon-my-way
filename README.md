# Recon My Way. 

Recon my way -- tools and setting up Guide. 

This repository contains the tools and scripts, I added in my recent blog post **Recon-My way**

https://medium.com/ehsahil/recon-my-way-82b7e5f62e21

I created this because there are many tools available these days and new users are confused which tools to use and which are not much useful. 

Anyone can contribute to this repository If they think they have a useful tool. 

I have also added my two simple scripts.
